a Website Mobile-Friendly Using CSS Media Queries
Project Overview 
This is a single-page website built with HTML and CSS that showcases a sneaker collection, primarily Air Jordan. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate responsive design, meaning the website automatically adjusts its layout to look good on both large computer screens and small mobile devices.

How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
The website has two main parts:

HTML (The Structure): This is the skeleton of the page. It sets up the main sections like the header, the main content area, the sidebar, and the footer. It also includes all the text and images about the sneakers.

CSS (The Style): This is what makes the page look good. The CSS styles are written in two parts:

Desktop Styles: The main styles set a wide, two-column layout for a computer screen.

Mobile Styles: A special rule called a media query (@media (max-width: 600px)) tells the browser to use a different set of styles when the screen is small (600 pixels or less). This rule is the key to making the site mobile-friendly, as it makes the two columns stack on top of each other.

The use of a media query lets the website change its appearance without needing to create a completely separate mobile version. This is an essential skill for web development!
